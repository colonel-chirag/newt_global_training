Creating a Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

Inserting Data

INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');

Querying Data

To retrieve data from a table, you can use the SELECT statement. For example, to get all users:


SELECT * FROM users;

Updating Data

You can update existing records using the UPDATE statement. For example, to change the email of a user:



UPDATE users
SET email = 'new_email@example.com'
WHERE username = 'john_doe';

Deleting Data

To delete records from a table, you can use the DELETE FROM statement. For example, to delete a user:



DELETE FROM users
WHERE username = 'john_doe';

Aggregation and Grouping

You can perform aggregate functions and group data using the GROUP BY clause. For example, to count the number of users per email domain:



SELECT SUBSTRING(email FROM POSITION('@' IN email) + 1) AS domain, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM users
GROUP BY domain;

Indexing

Indexing can improve query performance. You can create an index on a column like this:



CREATE INDEX idx_username ON users(username);
